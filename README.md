# Data_Cleaning_Challenge
Speedrunning cleaning a large data set of university crime with hundreds of columns and ~6000 universities and then filtering it to a readable and small data set. 
This is part of my overall project for the Friendly Cities Lab. I proceeded to analyze and present my findings to a lab team of PhD students afterwards.
